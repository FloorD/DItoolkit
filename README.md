# Diversity & Inclusion Toolkit

It's Microsoft's mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Microsoft Azure Cloud Developer Advocates agreed to not participate in events that do not adopt a Code of Conduct. In some cases CDAs have turned down speaking opportunities when the line-up for an event was exclusively - or overwhelmingly - white and male. For GitHub, a diverse line-up, Code of Conduct, and a commitment to inclusion are hard requirements for both 1st party events and 3rd party, community events participation. Twilio open sourced their guidelines for participating in community events - and requirements events need to meet in order to be considered for sponsoring.

The below Diversity & Inclusion Toolkit is meant for Microsoft internal use, but you're encouraged to share the kit with 3rd party organizers who seek for support from Microsoft for their events (monetary or otherwise).

This toolkit is not an `and-and or else !!1!`. Rather, it's a collection of information, best practices and resources to help you create a more inclusive experience for your event's participants.

## Safe space

Adopt a Code of Conduct to define community standards, signal a welcoming and inclusive environment and outline procedures for handling abuse. A Code of Conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community.

There's plenty Open Source templates to choose from:
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), used by over 40.000 open source projects, including Kubernetes and... Linux.
- [Citizen Code of conduct](https://www.citizencodeofconduct.org/)
- Microsoft Code of Conduct?

The most important thing is that you commit to the CoC you choose, and that you're willing and able to follow up on violations swiftly.

A Code of Conduct alone won't prevent inappropriate behavior at your event. To increase the effectiveness of your "CoC":
- Refer to, or publish your Code of Conduct on your event's page.
- Add a reference and read checkmark to your ticket registration process / page.
- Reference the Code of Conduct during the Opening Notes.
-- Stress that the Code of Conduct applies to (after)parties as well, even if these take place at a different location.
-- Stress that the CoC also applies to posts about the conference on social media.
- Install a Code of Conduct Enforcement Team.
-- You'll want team members that reflect diversity.
-- List ways of contacting (including anonymous), the different languages they can cover, and preferred pronouns.
-- Keep a slide with their contact details up on the screen during breaks.
-- Publish their content details in your conference booklet.

Other ways to create a safe space for all conference go-ers:
- Pick speakers that are not familiar with the area, or don't speak the language, up from the airport / train station / or wherever they arrive.
- Help attendees identify team members, provide organisers' t-shirts. Don't solely rely on color as a differentiating factor, and consider that some topical events might see a lot of one color (Red for Ruby events), so that might not be the best choice either.

## Diverse Speakers

A public and open Call for Papers won't guarantee papers from diverse submitters. You'll want to:
- Mention you're doing "blind selection", where the identity of the submitter is hidden until their talk has been selected.
-- Encourage submitters to respect that you wish not to know their identity until you've made your selection based on the abstracts you've received.
- Assemble a diverse team. Not only will they each bring their own valuable perspective, but by showing you have a diverse team, there's more people for potential speakers to identify with and feel empowered to participate in your CfP.
- Promote your CfP in diverse communities, ask those communities' leaders for help.
- Promote your CfP on confs.tech
- Signal what you're looking for by publishing a diverse (invited) keynotes line-up first, and while the public CfP is still open.
- List the ways you support speakers that have a disability, or will need child care.
- Explain what costs you cover. Are you reimbursing or booking? How many days lodging are included?

## Diversity Ticket Scheme

A Diversity Ticket Scheme aids individuals that would otherwise not be able to afford attendance to take part in events. A Diversity Scheme covers conference entrance (ticket), and sometimes travel and/or lodging. Before booking travel or accommodation, it's best to get a feeling for the individual's understanding of a "safe space". You will also want to inquire about the individual's needs or preferences regarding travel.

Make sure diversity tickets provide the same level of access as the tickets from general sales.

[Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) is a Travis Foundation initiative, supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, where attendees can find and apply for upcoming events, and organizers can submit their upcoming events. The Travis Foundation team can help organizers select eligible applications, in exchange for a donation.

## Diversity Program

Host a workshop for beginners / underrepresented groups prior to, or alongside your event. Plenty of workshops and resources for beginners are open source, like [Rails Girls](https://www.railsgirls.com) (a Ruby on Rails beginners course), [Django Girls](https://www.djangogirls.com), Girls who Code, Black Girls Code, ...

## Child Care

Supporting speakers who are parents, so they can bring their infant to your conference is a wonderful service you could provide. Think of:
- Supporting their partner's or co-caregiver's travel and lodging.
- Arrange for accommodation with a kod, changing table and other necessities.
- Provide a nursing/lactation room, with a changing table.
- Child care on-site.

## Accessibility

- Check that your venue is, or can be altered to be, (wheelchair) accessible.
- Reserve accessible seating in the front row.
- Help your speakers with templates for accessible slides, as well as best practices in terms of typography and color usage.
-- The [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) (CCA) helps you determine the legibility of text and the contrast of visual elements, such as graphical controls and visual indicators. And it's available for download.
-- Raise awareness and have a talk about WCAG, and accessibility of content.
- Provide a livestream, or recording to reach an audience unable to attend otherwise.
- Provide transcriptions / captioning.
-- Raise awareness and have the person doing the captioning demo their work.

### Misc
- Ask attendees for dietary restrictions upon registration. Use an open input field, or find a comprehensive list of diets, allergies and intolerances.
- Provide gender including bathrooms, if possible in addition to gendered bathrooms.
-- Provide care kits (sanitary pads, tampons, tissues, deodorant, mints) in *all* toilets
- Check (local) bank holidays, make sure people are generally able to attend.
- Create visibility around Diversity & Inclusion. For example: host a speaker at your event who can talk about mental health in tech via [Prompt](http://mhprompt.org/).
